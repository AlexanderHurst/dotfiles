# dotfiles
All of the packages and important configurations for my current workspace. These are used so that I can get myself up and running on a new machine in minutes.

On arch based systems the install.sh and update.sh files can be used to automatically install all software and copy all configs, or update all software and configs respectively. Configuration files are only copied from explicit directories due to potential security risks as well as an abundance of default configs that do not need to be migrated.
